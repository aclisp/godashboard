issues:
  # We do not use golangci-lint's default list of exclusions because some of
  # them are not good for us (we prefer strictness):
  #
  # - Not requiring published functions to have comments.
  # - Not warning about ineffective break statements.
  # - And more that don't effect Vecty itself.
  #
  exclude-use-default: false

  # List of regexps of issue texts to exclude, empty list by default.
  exclude:
    # https://github.com/hexops/vecty/issues/226
    - "comment on exported function Timeout should be of the form"

    # errcheck: Almost all programs ignore errors on these functions and in most cases it's ok
    - Error return value of .((os\.)?std(out|err)\..*|.*Close|.*Flush|os\.Remove(All)?|.*printf?|os\.(Un)?Setenv). is not checked

    # golint: False positive when tests are defined in package 'test'
    - func name will be used as test\.Test.* by other packages, and that stutters; consider calling this
